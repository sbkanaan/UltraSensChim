The files in this repository contain primary data (except patient data files) used in the analyses for our manuscript entitled:

### Ultrasensitive Chimerism Enhances Measurable Residual Disease Testing Post-Allogeneic Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation
< insert doi link here >
##
Moreover, it contains Experimental User Guidelines, Templates for planning, running, and analyzing Ultrasensitive Chimerism quantification experiments.

Information about the HLA-specific assays, plus GSTT1, AT3, and TG genomic regions and their designed molecular assay oligonucleotides (primers and fluorogenic probes) are available in patent [US 10,604,805-B2](https://patentcenter.uspto.gov/applications/14382105). Those of TNN and the “Chi” series of assays are undisclosed and awaiting patent filing; but, these can be shared upon reasonable request. Please contact the study's corresponding author (owner of this repository) at: skanaan@chimerocyte.com

The goal is to make it easy for anyone to try and use our experiemental setups and analyses on their own projects and data.
