This repository contains [Primary Data](https://github.com/sbkanaan/UltraSensChim/tree/master/04_Code_and_primarydata_BloodAdvances_paper/Primary_data) (except files containing patient data) and the [R code](https://github.com/sbkanaan/UltraSensChim/blob/master/04_Code_and_primarydata_BloodAdvances_paper/221103_Chimerocyte_Rel_alloHCT.rmd) used in the analyses for our manuscript entitled:

Moreover, this repository contains [Experimental User Guidelines](https://github.com/sbkanaan/UltraSensChim/tree/master/01_Planning_Templates), and Templates for [planning](https://github.com/sbkanaan/UltraSensChim/tree/master/01_Planning_Templates), [running](https://github.com/sbkanaan/UltraSensChim/tree/master/02_Running_on_QantStudio5), and [analyzing](https://github.com/sbkanaan/UltraSensChim/tree/master/03_Analyzing_Templates) Ultrasensitive Chimerism quantification experiments.

Information about the HLA-specific assays, plus GSTT1, AT3, and TG genomic regions and their designed molecular assay oligonucleotides (primers and fluorogenic probes) are available in patent [US 10,604,805-B2](https://patentcenter.uspto.gov/applications/14382105). Those of TNN and the “Chi” series of assays are undisclosed and awaiting patent filing; but, these can be shared upon reasonable request. Please contact the study's corresponding author (owner of this repository) at: skanaan@chimerocyte.com

The goal is to make it transparent for anyone who wishes to use our experiemental and analytic setup, for them to apply on their own projects and data.
